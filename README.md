# SkyNetReboot-How-To-Use-AI
SkyNet has been rebooted... but this time, it’s here to help you master AI (not destroy humanity).

# Guide to Using AI and Real-Time Search Tools

## **1. Overview**
This guide explains how to use AI (e.g., OpenAI ChatGPT) in combination with real-time search tools to get better results. While AI cannot directly search real-time data, you can provide it with information from search tools to receive creative and practical responses.  
**Logical thinking and speaking in a way that the other person understands leads to better answers.** The more clearly and specifically you write your prompts, the more useful the answers will be.

## **2. How to Use**

### **1) Check Real-Time Data Using Search Tools**
- **Recommended Tools**:
  - Google Search: For real-time news, weather, and trends.
  - Yahoo Finance: For stock and financial data.
  - AccuWeather: For weather updates by location.

### **2) Provide Data to AI**
- **Summarize or request additional insights from AI**:
  - Example: "It looks like it will rain in New York this weekend. Suggest some indoor activities."

### **3) Use AI for Creative Applications**
- AI can provide additional analysis, summaries, or creative ideas based on the data.
  - Example: "Give me unique reasons to visit this place and why it’s worth it."
